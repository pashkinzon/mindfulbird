# Introduction to the Online Therapist Database Project

In an ever-changing world, where stress and emotional challenges can be overwhelming, mental health and counseling 
services play a pivotal role in supporting individuals' well-being. To cater to the growing demand for accessible therapeutic assistance,
I embarked on an exciting journey to create an Online Therapist Database using SQL. This project showcases my skills in designing 
and managing a relational database, as well as my ability to create a comprehensive platform for finding therapists online.

# Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to develop an efficient and user-friendly database system that facilitates 
seamless connections between clients and therapists. By crafting an intelligently structured database, my goal was to demonstrate 
how SQL can be harnessed to build a robust foundation for an online platform that empowers users to discover and connect with their ideal therapists.

# Project Overview

The foundation of the Online Therapist Database revolves around carefully designed tables that capture crucial entities of the platform. 

**Clients Table**

This table stores information about clients using the service, including their unique ID, first name, last name, email, and a brief bio.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Clients (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    bio TEXT
);
```

**Therapists Table**

This table holds data about therapists registered on the platform. It includes their unique ID, first name, last name, email, bio, and registration date.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Therapists (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    bio TEXT,
    registration_date DATE
);
```

**Specializations Table**

This table allows therapists to specify their areas of expertise. It contains unique IDs and specialization names.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Specializations (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Client Reviews Table**

This table records reviews submitted by clients for their therapy sessions. It includes a unique review ID, client ID, therapist ID, rating, review text, and date.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ClientReviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INT,
    therapist_id INT,
    rating FLOAT,
    review_text TEXT,
    date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES Clients(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES Therapists(id)
);
```

**Availability Table**

The Availability table stores information about therapists' weekly schedules, including unique IDs, therapist IDs, the day of the week, start time, and end time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Availability (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    therapist_id INT,
    day_of_week VARCHAR(20),
    start_time TIME,
    end_time TIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES Therapists(id)
);
```

**Sessions Table**

This table acts as a bridge between clients and therapists, storing session data such as unique IDs, client IDs, therapist IDs, session date, a flag indicating whether the session happened, and the payment status.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sessions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INT,
    therapist_id INT,
    date DATE,
    if_happened BOOLEAN,
    payment_status ENUM('pending', 'completed', 'cancelled'), 
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES Clients(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES Therapists(id)
);
```

**Session Notes Table**

The Session Notes table holds notes related to therapy sessions. It contains unique IDs, session IDs, general session notes, and private notes intended only for therapists.

```sql
CREATE TABLE SessionNotes (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id INT,
    notes_text TEXT,
    therapist_private_notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES Sessions(id)
);
```

**Payment Transactions Table**

This table records payment transactions associated with therapy sessions. It includes unique IDs, session IDs, client IDs, therapist IDs, payment amounts, and dates.

```sql
CREATE TABLE PaymentTransactions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id INT, 
    client_id INT,
    therapist_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES Sessions(id), 
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES Clients(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES Therapists(id)
);
```

**Participants Table**

The Participants table serves as a centralized entity for both clients and therapists. It includes unique IDs, first name, last name, email, bio, and a type flag indicating whether the participant is a client or a therapist.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Participants (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    bio TEXT,
    type ENUM('client', 'therapist') 
);
```

**Chat Messages Table**

This table facilitates communication between clients and therapists within a session chat. It includes unique message IDs, session IDs, sender IDs, receiver IDs, message text, and timestamps.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ChatMessages (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id INT,
    sender_id INT,
    receiver_id INT,
    message_text TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES Sessions(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES Participants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (receiver_id) REFERENCES Participants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Therapist Credentials Table**

This table holds data about therapists' credentials, such as degrees or certifications. It includes unique IDs, therapist IDs, qualification names, issuing institutions, and completion years.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Credentials (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    therapist_id INT,
    qualification VARCHAR(100),
    issuing_institution VARCHAR(100),
    completion_year INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES Therapists(id)
);
```

**Therapist Languages Table**

This table stores the languages in which therapists can communicate. It includes unique IDs, therapist IDs, and language names.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Languages (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    therapist_id INT,
    language VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES Therapists(id)
);
```
The schema of the resulting database was then provided to the data scientists' team. 
This schema serves as a visual representation of the SQL tables and the relationships between 
them, aiding in understanding the database structure and data flow.

# Data Input

The entire dataset for the SQL database was automatically generated using advanced AI tools, ensuring that all 
data matches were generated purely by coincidence and do not represent real-world associations or relationships.

The sample data for this SQL database can be found in the GitHub repository within the SQL code file.

# Data Manipulation and Demonstration 

The Online Therapist Database project not only encompasses the creation of the database but also entails a range of SQL queries 
to showcase the system's functionality. I can execute queries to retrieve information such as therapist availability, client activity, 
client reviews, payment transactions, and more.

# Conclusion

The Online Therapist Database project showcases my expertise in SQL and database management. Through the creation of this comprehensive 
and sophisticated platform, I aim to illustrate the capabilities of SQL in designing efficient, scalable, and user-friendly databases for 
contemporary online services. This project stands as a testament to my commitment to leveraging technology to promote a healthier and happier 
world, where therapy is easily accessible to those in need.
